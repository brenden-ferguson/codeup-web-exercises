<p>National Park FAQ</p>
<dl>
  <dt id="dt-1">How many national parks are there in total in the United States?</dt>
  <dd class="invisible noShow-1 highlight">There are currently 63 national parks in the United States. The most recently established national park
    is New River Gorge National Park, located in West Virginia. The national park system includes
    423 national park sites in total. These sites include memorials, national historic landmarks,
    heritage areas, etc. Most national parks are located
    in the western United States, in states such as California, Utah and Colorado.
  </dd>

  <dt id="dt-2">Which national parks are the best?</dt>
  <dd class="invisible noShow-2 highlight">We think that every national park is worth visiting. However, there are some national parks that
    are particularly unique in the world due to their geography. To get the best national park experience,
    we recommend visiting the Grand Canyon, Yosemite, Yellowstone, Rocky Mountain, Zion, and
    Arches National Parks in the Western United States. Within the Eastern United States, the most famous
    national parks are Acadia, Great Smoky Mountains, and Everglades. Browse our national park trip
    itineraries by region for trip ideas, planning essentials, and national park travel inspiration.
  </dd>

  <dt id="dt-3">Which national parks have the most visitors?</dt>
  <dd class="invisible noShow-3 highlight">Popular national parks with the most overnight visitors are Grand Canyon, Yosemite & Yellowstone.
    However, several national parks have are more popular for day visitors, making them feel
    more private and secluded from sundown to sunrise. For national parks with a
    higher amount of overnight visitors, we recommend making lodging and camping reservations in advance.
  </dd>

  <dt id="dt-4">Which national parks have the most wildlife?</dt>
  <dd class="invisible noShow-4 highlight">All national parks have wildlife from snakes and birds to larger animals such as wolves,
    bears, moose and buffalo and even marine life. To see the most wildlife we always recommend
    national parks that cover large forest areas such as Theodore Roosevelt National Park, Isle Royale,
    Rocky Mountain or Alaska’s Denali National Park. Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming is often referred to as
    the “Serengeti of America” because of its abundant variety of wildlife.
  </dd>

  <dt id="dt-5">Do national parks have guided tours?</dt>
  <dd class="invisible noShow-5 highlight">Yes, each national park offers guided tours that can either be hosted by the National Park Service (NPS)
    or by certified guides. A large part of the National Park Service mission aims to educate visitors
    about the uniqueness of each different park and how to enjoy each park to its fullest. Find information
    about guided tours at official park visitor and
    welcome centers or research for certified guides in gateway towns.
  </dd>

  <dt id="dt-6">How many people visit national parks each year?</dt>
  <dd class="invisible noShow-6 highlight">Last year, there were 327 million national park visits in the United States. Some national parks, like Zion,
    can become overcrowded during warmer months and require visitors to use park
    transportation rather than personal vehicles.
    Therefore, we recommend visiting during off-season months.
  </dd>

  <dt id="dt-7">Are there general rules when visiting a national park or does each park have specific ones?</dt>
  <dd class="invisible noShow-7 highlight">Yes, there are general rules when visiting national parks and you will find this
    information on the official national park website. In addition, each national park has specific
    rules that can change seasonally. For example, campfire regulations may fluctuate depending on
    drought conditions and the risk of wildfires.
  </dd>

  <dt id="dt-8">Where can I find official park maps?</dt>
  <dd class="invisible noShow-8 highlight">We think the best way to utilize a complete map of all national parks on a map is to use the
    Find Your Park tool provided by the National Park Service website. Many national parks have digital,
    downloadable versions of park maps as well hard copies in visitor and welcome centers.
  </dd>

  <dt id="dt-9">How do I make reservations for camping or staying in national parks?</dt>
  <dd class="invisible noShow-9 highlight">Most of the campsites in national parks and national forests are available on a first-come,
    first serve basis, but we still recommend travelers make reservations online whenever possible.
    We highly recommend making online reservations for popular national parks
    at least three to five months in advance.
  </dd>

  <dt id="dt-10">Can I drive into a national park and is there an entrance fee?</dt>
  <dd class="invisible noShow-10 highlight">Most of the national parks in the United States are accessible by car, RV or bus. When you enter the park,
    you’ll need to pay an entrance fee, which is usually between $20-$40 per vehicle. Park passes can be
    valid for up to seven days depending on the park and season. If you plan to visit several national parks,
    we recommend you buy the America the Beautiful Pass for $80.
